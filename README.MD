My clone of Doodle Jump; Nothing special, really

I don`t have plans on continuing this project, but if I do it some day, here are ideas to implement:

- enemies, like in original doodle jump
- some special traits on platforms. For example, some platform might work as trampoline, and other might temporarily decrease player`s jump height, or reverse inputs, etc.
